# Ft_ls

In short: This project will make you recode the command “ls”
The ls command is one of the first commands you have learned to use with shell.
Thanks to this project I now know how the 'ls' function is coded.

## Objective
Recoding ls and some of its options allowed me to find out how to interact with the file system using C.
After all, I already know how to open, read, write and close a file. But, what about the directories?
Special files? Rights, dates or sizes of the files?

The project ft_ls opens the path to the Unix branch of the sphere system.
Amongst the numerous options available, I had to create the
following: -l, -R, -a, -r and -t.
